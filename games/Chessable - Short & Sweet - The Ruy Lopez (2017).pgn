{Introduction The Ruy Lopez is an opening which needs no introduction (however I 
shall provide it with one in any case!). Opening Characteristics The Ruy Lopez 
features a plethora of ideas, plans and manoeuvres - so many that it is 
impossible to mention all in this introduction. Instead, these ideas will be 
explained as we come across them in the analysis. The general idea behind the 
whole Ruy Lopez opening can be explained rather simply though. White wants to 
play d4 (after preparing it with c3) in order to build up the 'perfect centre'. 
Black spends his opening moves deciding how to deal with this plan of White's. 
His fundamental goal is not to surrender the e5 strongpoint by playing ...exd4. 
If he is forced to play this, white will usually be comfortably better. Black 
has a large variety of plans and setups in the Ruy Lopez, all of which have a 
focus on harmonious and fluid development. There are numerous piece manoeuvres 
at Black's disposal to rearrange his pieces, such as ...Nb8-d7 (the Breyer) and 
the kingside bishop fianchetto. Sometimes Black plays ...Na5 with the idea of 
...c5 to control d4. There are many ideas for both sides, which is why the Ruy 
Lopez is amongst the strategically-richest chess openings and one of the main 
battlegrounds for chess beginners and World Champions alike. The Short & Sweet 
Approach The Ruy Lopez is a vast opening which has built up a tremendous body of 
opening theory behind it. Since the emphasis in the Short & Sweet series is on 
easy-to-learn but decent repertoires, choosing the absolute mainline for White 
would result in a course which is 3 times as complex. Instead, variations have 
been chosen that are not as theoretical, but remain perfectly sound. Often when 
looking for such variations, all one has to do is look at the games of Carlsen - 
it is well-known that he thrives in fresh, unexplored lines. It should therefore 
come as no surprise to Ruy Lopez practitioners that the primary focus in this 
repertoire will be on variations with an early d3. Specifically, in the mainline 
Ruy Lopez 6. d3 will be played and the Berlin Endgame will be dodged with 4. d3. 
Should I Play the Ruy Lopez? The Ruy Lopez offers plenty of chances for both 
sides and its ideas and plans are often applicable in other openings. Learning 
to play it well should improve your general chess ability since the Ruy Lopez is 
based on very positional themes. There are concrete variations and move orders 
which players do need to know, which makes the Ruy Lopez quite complex. Wild 
complications and sacrifices are rare, however, so if you prefer those positions 
the Ruy Lopez is probably not for you.} 1. -- *

{[%cal Ga2g8][%csl Rf7] Positionally, the Schliemann Defence seems perfectly 
justified. It is advantageous to trade your flank pawn for a central one, after 
all, and Black has ended up with two central pawns against White's single 
e-pawn. However, concrete problems arise for Black as a result of his missing 
f7-pawn. Because of the missing f7-pawn, the a2-g8 diagonal is wide open which 
means that Black's castled king can become vulnerable along that diagonal.} 
({Alternatively, Black can even be prevented from castling because of that open 
diagonal. 6... Bc5 is the more common of the two main moves - the other one 
being 6... d6. We handle 6... d6 in a similar way to 6... Bc5 - abusing the 
a2-g8 diagonal. For example,} 6... d6 7. Nc3 Be7 {and now} 8. Bc4 $1 {prevents 
castling and is very irritating.}) 7. Qd3 $1 {[%cal Bd3c4,Gc4c5,Gc4g8][%csl Rc5]

Qc4+.} d6 {[%cal Gd6c5] Black protects the bishop and intends to castle on his 
next move.} 8. Qc4 $14 {[%cal Gc4g8,Bb1c3,Bc3d5][%csl Gd5] White prevents 
castling once again. This is extremely irritating for Black and he will be 
forced to spend a few moves to solve the problem. White's plan is to play Nc3 
next and then plant his knight on d5.} *

with Na5. White's better pawn structure and semi-open a-file makes White's 
position slightly preferable to me - clearly there are decent chances for both 
sides here though.} *

Choice For the purposes of this repertoire, we'll be recommending 8. a3. It is 
quite fresh, interesting and it can cause Black some tricky problems if he 
doesn't know how to deal with it. There's a good chance that opponents will be 
unfamiliar with this, especially if they don't stay up-to-date on theory. All 3 
of the main moves have been played by Carlsen (amongst numerous other 
world-class players), meaning that they are all perfectly viable. It wouldn't be

main points to this little 8. a3 move: • 1. The most obvious point is that the 
light-squared bishop has the a2 retreat square available once Black kicks our 
bishop around with ...Na5. Unlike 8. a4, Black isn't afforded the opportunity to 
play ...bxa4 at some point. • 2. Often once Black has played ...Na5 (which he 
usually will) White can counter by dropping his bishop back to a2 and then 
kicking the knight away with b4. This b4 move is a recurring idea which claims 
space and halts Black's queenside expansion. • 3. By playing a3 White prepares 
an eventual Nc3-Nd5 in certain positions.} O-O {This natural move is Black's 
most common choice but it might not be the best.} 9. Nc3 {[%cal Bc3d5][%csl Gd5]

interesting imbalance in the position.} Bg4 {[%cal Gg4d1,Bc6d4][%csl Rf3] This 
developing move is Black's most common choice. The idea is for Black to plant 
his own knight on d4.} 10. Be3 {[%cal Ge3d4] If White isn't careful he could end 
up with nasty doubled f-pawns after ...Nd4xf3.} Nd4 11. Bxd4 exd4 12. Nd5 Nd7

without too many problems however after} 8... Na5 {followed by ...c5. It's still 
very playable of course and has been utilised by Carlsen a number of times (all 
3 of the main moves in this position have).}) ({•} d6 8. a4 {is White's second 
most common move and it is played with the idea of chipping away at Black's 
b5-pawn while providing a retreat square for our light-squared bishop on a2. 
Black however can maintain his pawn on b5 with} 8... Bd7 {and has found ways to 
neutralise white's idea. Without going into too much detail, in certain 
positions Black can play ...Na5 followed by ...bxa4 which gives Black good play 
down the b-file. White can play a4 + c3 on the next move though with a roughly 
equal game with good chances for both sides.}) ({•} d6 8. a3 {is the 'newest' 
of these moves and as a result the third most common. It became very topical at 
the elite level a few years ago. It has a couple of interesting points, which 
we'll delve into on the next move.}) {Repertoire Choice For the purposes of this 
repertoire, we'll be recommending 8. a3. It is quite fresh, interesting and it 
can cause Black some tricky problems if he doesn't know how to deal with it. 
There's a good chance that opponents will be unfamiliar with this, especially if 
they don't stay up-to-date on theory. All 3 of the main moves have been played 
by Carlsen (amongst numerous other world-class players), meaning that they are 
all perfectly viable. It wouldn't be a bad idea for players who wish to do their 
own analysis to begin their explorations with White's options in this position. 
Looking at the alternative ideas will give you a better feel for the ideas, 
plans, etc.} 8. a3 $1 {This is an interesting little move which contains quite a 
bit of venom if black goes about business as usual. I see 3 main points to this 
little 8. a3 move: • 1. The most obvious point is that the light-squared 
bishop has the a2 retreat square available once Black kicks our bishop around 
with ...Na5. Unlike 8. a4, Black isn't afforded the opportunity to play ...bxa4 
at some point. • 2. Often once Black has played ...Na5 (which he usually will) 
White can counter by dropping his bishop back to a2 and then kicking the knight 
away with b4. This b4 move is a recurring idea which claims space and halts 
Black's queenside expansion. • 3. By playing a3 White prepares an eventual 
Nc3-Nd5 in certain positions.} Na5 {[%cal Bc7c5,Ga5b3][%csl Rb3] This move is 
the recommendation of Ntirlis in 'Playing 1. e4 e5!' and he credits Svidler's 
Chess24 video series for the idea. Black delays castling for another move so he 
can get the queenside situation under control.} 9. Ba2 c5 {[%csl Gc5,Gd6,Ge5] 
Having the pawn on c5 before white has made the b4 break allows Black more 
flexibility in dealing with it.} 10. b4 $5 {[%cal Gb4c5,Gb4a5]} ({This move has 
only been played once at the time of writing, but it seems like a good attempt 
to get out of the known paths.} 10. Nc3 {is the natural choice and has been 
played over 30 times. Naturally it is worth taking a look at that move as well 
if you choose to play this variation.}) Nc6 {[%cal Gc6b4,Gc5b4][%csl Rb4]} 
({Black can play} 10... cxb4 {, but it does give White a slightly preferable 
pawn structure (2 islands vs 1). 10... Nc6 was Ntirlis' recommendation, after 
which his analysis stopped.}) 11. bxc5 {This exchange unbalances the pawn 
structure and allows White to plant his knight on d5 shortly.} dxc5 12. Nc3 
{[%cal Bc3d5][%csl Gd5] The knight is heading for d5 of course.} O-O {[%cal 
Bc3d5][%csl Bd5]} 13. Nd5 $11 {[%cal Ba3a4,Bc1b2,Gb2e5,Gf3e5][%csl Gd5,Ra3] 
White probably can't try to claim any sort of advantage here, but he certainly 
isn't worse either. Our knight on d5 clamps down on most counterplay Black would 
have been thinking of. The biggest weakness in White's position is white's 
isolated pawn, so it's logical to try deal with this next by playing a4. Our 
dark-squared bishop is also well-placed on b2 where it targets the vulnerable 
e5-pawn.} *

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {So far all this should be familiar to you, of course. However 
instead of the natural and most common, 2... Nc6, Black can opt for either 2... 
d6 or 2... Nf6. These defences, known as the Philidor and the Petroff 
respectively, are significantly rarer than 2... Nc6, but I thought they should 
be covered for the sake of completeness.} d6 {[%cal Gd6e5] The Philidor Defence 
- Black supports his e5-pawn with a pawn, instead of the knight. The Philidor is 
frequently essayed by players who prefer quiet and positional games - often 
Black will follow up with ...Nf6, ...Nd7 ...Be7, ...c6 and ...O-O. His setup is 
very flexible, albeit not that ambitious. Alternatively, he can cede the centre 
- after 3. d4 - and attempt to generate counterplay down the e-file.} 3. d4 
{[%csl Gd4,Ge4,Re5] One of the main downsides of black's last moves is that 
...d6 has hardly any influence on the centre. This gives white a free hand to 
play the space-gaining 3. d4.} ({At this stage, Black faces a choice: he can 
either surrender the centre with} 3. d4 3... exd4 {and seek central counterplay 
later,}) ({or he can try support his e5 pawn bastion with} 3. d4 3... Nd7 {.}) 
Nd7 {[%cal Bg8f6,Bf8e7,Be8g8,Gd7e5][%csl Ge5] With this move Black intends to 
hold on to the little slice of the centre he has - the e5-pawn. Black plans to 
develop simply and soundly, with move such as ...Be7, ...Nf6, ...O-O, ...c6 
etc.} ({It's important to note that one of black's primary alternatives,} 3... 
Nf6 {, is bound to transpose to either 3... exd4 or 3... Nd7 after} 4. Nc3 {.}) 
4. Nc3 {Natural development.} Ngf6 {Against Black's setup, I have decided to 
recommend a simple, natural but strong setup based on Bc4, O-O and a4. It 
requires very little theoretical knowledge and risks little compared to the more 
flamboyant variations which usually involve g4.} 5. Bc4 {A good, natural square 
for the bishop.} Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. a4 $14 {[%cal 
Ba4a5,Ga4b5,Bf1e1,Bc1e3,Gf3h4,Gh4f5][%csl Gf5] This move is played in order to 
curb black's intended queenside expansion with ...a6 and ...b5 by playing a5 to 
stop it. In general, if Black captures on d4 in this position, it is safe to 
recapture with our queen since there is no knight coming to c6 to harass it. 
White should continue development with Re1 and Be3. From there, his plan could 
go in any number of directions - one possible idea is a knight manoeuvre to f5 
via h4.} *

5. Nc3 {[%cal Gc3e4] White protects e4 of course. This position can be reached 
through a variety of different move orders. Black has two possible development 
schemes here at his disposal:} ({1. The usual Philidor-style natural} 5. Nc3 
5... Be7 {development. This has the advantage of saving some time and keeping 
the king safer. On the other hand, the bishop might not be quite as active as it 
would be on the long diagonal - a1-h8. This will be covered in a bit more depth 
as it is more common.}) ({2. The Dragon-style} 5. Nc3 5... g6 {fianchetto - this 
is significantly rarer than ...Be7 plans. It tends to be a bit slower, which can 
potentially get Black's king into some trouble. Additionally, and very 
importantly, moving the pawn to ...g6 gives white a 'hook' to latch onto and 
dark squares to exploit. This means that White's plan will often be in the 
spirit of the Yugoslav Attack (in the Sicilian Dragon). We will play Be3, Qd2, 
f3 and possibly long castles. h4-h5 is one idea to open up Black's king and it's 
also common to trade off Black's key kingside defender with Be3-h6. Black lacks 
his usual counterplay that is typical of the dragon - this is because the wrong 
file is open (White will castle long and the c-file is closed, which would 
normally be the basis for Black's counterattack).}) Be7 {Black's safer option - 
he develops rapidly and gets his king safe, without allowing for a big white 
kingside attack.} 6. Be2 O-O 7. O-O ({If you intend to launch a kingside attack, 
an alternative is the flexible} 7. Bf4 {followed by long castling.}) Re8 {Black 
puts his rook where it belongs - on the e-file to attack our pawn. His bishop 
will most likely be dropped back to f8.} 8. Re1 $14 {[%cal 
Be2f1,Bc1f4,Bd1d2,Ba1d1] It makes sense for what to follow suit and put his rook 
on the same file. I'd prefer not to rush my pawn to f4, which could end up 
leaving e4 exposed. Next White will most likely play Bf4 and play along the 
central files. His space advantage and well-developed pieces should grant him an 
edge.} *
